# RFID-BASED-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
INTRODUCTION 	

Background 

The current attendance system is manual. Manual means that the work of taking attendance, analyzing and maintaining is a physical task. Current attendance system takes lot of time and papers. Teachers needs to wait for all children and then take attendance. If the strength of the class is 80-100 student then it wastes the time and paper both student and teachers. Here there is double work that needs to be done that is and maintain the attendance record. The teacher needs to enter data in master rolls and the paper works increases. On a daily basis at least, a particular class has its attendances sheet. Therefor on a daily basis as a large number of papers is used. This creates a big load of paper records and to maintain is tough job. On another note it creates a massive paper wastage. More records are made on monthly basis or semester basis. It leads to searching of records in huge papers bubbles. This makes analyzing more hectic. The other drawback is that if a student I not present in lectures the parents are notified. No notification feature is provided in current manual attendance system. 

Objectives 

The main objective is to make the attendance system automatic and easy with the help of RFID based Attendance System. The RFID Attendance System will help to save a lot of time and paperwork. Another main objective of the proposed project is that the parents will be notified about their children attending lectures or not. It will help to maintain a good record of attendance without any errors. This is help to save the both teachers and students time and efforts.  Purpose The main purpose of the proposed project is to make current attendance system i.e. Manual to Automatic. The purpose and aim is to save a lot of time and papers by making system automatic and help teacher and student. It will also make the job of analyzing the record and retrieving the record easier and faster. The maintenance of records is really a mess and there can be a loss of records and human errors that can cause damaging the records so the RFID attendance system helps to reduce the human errors and make the process easy. One of the important purposes of the project is being developed so that the parents can be notified and know about their children activities. Scope The project can be implemented in small or big colleges. Our project will help to reduce the papers and for maintaining the attendance record and also the work required to analyzing the records of attendance. It will make the process of attendance and maintaining for particular school/colleges. The RFID cards are easy to carry in wallets or bags. They are very light weight. Student can just punch the cards and their attendance will be recorded. It will help both student and teachers and reduce time and paper wastage.

Applicability 

The application of the project is that attendance is marked automatically no need of paper. This product can be used in all school and colleges or even in offices. This will reduce the usage of paper and manpower required. The analyzing of data that takes lot of time. There will be no longer waiting time for taking attendance and wasting time. Student can just swap the card and attendance will be recorded.  This project is very useful for the colleges as it will eliminate use of paper and save cost and make the process of storage and metrical easy.

SURVEY OF TECHNOLOGIES 

Front-End 

The Front-End of an application is visible part of it that uses interacts with it. It will analyze the code, design, and debugging application along with ensuring a seamless user experience.  It is a particular set of technical skills, tools and knowledge-based environment for frontend development. The Following programming languages can be used for creating our projects frontend.

(1) HTML 

Hypertext Mark-up Language is standard mark-up language for creating webpages and web applications with type code TEXT it is developed by W3C. The initial release was in 1973, 25yrs ago. The format here is Document File Format Web Browser receives HTML document from server and sender document in multimedia pages Html elements contains HTML constricts, image and other objects such as interactive forms HTML can be embedded into Scripting languages such as JavaScript and CSS.

(2) CSS 

Cascading Style Sheet is style sheet language used for describing the presentation of document written in a mark-up language like HTML .CSS is a comer stone technology of world with web alongside HTML and JavaScript. The initial release in Dec 17, 1996.The format is style sheet language .CSS is designed to enable separation of presentation a context including layout, colour and fonts. The separation of formatting and make it feasible to some mark-up page in different style for different rendering methods.

(3) C# 

C# is pronounced as C# in general purpose and component-oriented programming languages. It developed in 208 by Microsoft with .Net initialization. C# is intended to be suitable for working web application and embedded application. It is portable only for windows therefore it is not cross platform is not that huge in developing the websites in todayâ€™s market. 

(4) PHP 

Php Hypertext Processor is a programming language allows web development to create dynamic content interact with database. Php is basically used for web-based applications. It uses general purpose programming language. It can be used in different like UNIX, Windows etc. It uses command line scripting. Php can be used in RDBMS platforms. It is free of cost and can be work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
 
 
 
 
Back-End 

 Backend usually means that do work in building applications but the user is unaware of it or cannot see. Backend is basically how the site works, updates and changes. Backend usually contains database to handle the data generated during dynamic transactions. Backend provides indirect support to frontend services. It helps to communicate with required resources. Some of the backend are mentioned below. 
 
 (1) Microsoft Access 

MS Access is a Database Management System from Microsoft that set relational database engine with a graphical user interface software development tool. It stores data in its own format based on the access set database engine. It is a relational database that allows you to link related information together. User can create tables, queries, forms and reports 
and connect them together with macros access also have report creation method that can work with any data source that access. 

(2) MongoDB 

MongoDB is an open source document database. It is a leading NoSQL database. MongoDB is highly scalable and performance-oriented database. MongoDB provides a cross platform, document-oriented database that gives highly availability and easy scalability. MongoDB stores data in unstructured format rather than going for structured format. MongoDB provides features like Indexing, Replication and Sharding. MongoDB uses scale out approach. 

(3) Oracle Database  

Oracle Database is a Multimodal database management system produced and marketed by oracle corporation. This database is commonly used for running online transactions processing, data warehousing and mixed database workloads. It is a multimodal database. Oracle database is a licensed software. Oracle provides various services like cloud services with database and offline database. It helps in data mining and analytics of data using various algorithms. 

(4) MySQL 

MySQL is an opensource rational database system. Its name is combination of My & SQL the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. It is first released on 23rd May 1995 and was developed with the help of C, C++. It provides cross platforms feature i.e. it can work on almost all high profile, large scale websites including Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. It is a widely used RDMS in the market. It has been most trusted and faster RDMS in the market. It has been most trusted and faster RDMS software.
